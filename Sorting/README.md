# Java Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains Java implementations of various popular sorting algorithms for both integer and string arrays.
These examples are designed to help beginners understand how sorting works through hands-on practice and code exploration.

## 📁 Contents

The project includes the following sorting algorithms:

### 🔁 Bubble Sort
- **`BubbleSort1.java`** – Sorts an integer array using the Bubble Sort technique.
- **`BubbleSort2.java`** – Sorts a string array alphabetically using Bubble Sort.

### 📥 Insertion Sort
- **`InsertionSort.java`** – Sorts an integer array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

### 🔀 Merge Sort
- **`MergeSort.java`** – Uses the Divide and Conquer strategy to sort an integer array via Merge Sort.

### ⚡ Quick Sort
- **`QuickSort.java`** – Sorts an integer array using Quick Sort with the **first element** as the pivot.
- **`QuickSortMiddle.java`** – Sorts an integer array using Quick Sort with the **middle element** as the pivot.

### 🔽 Selection Sort
- **`SelectionSort1.java`** – Sorts an integer array using Selection Sort.
- **`SelectionSort2.java`** – Sorts a string array alphabetically using Selection Sort.
