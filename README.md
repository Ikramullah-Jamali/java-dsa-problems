# 📘 Java Sorting and Searching Algorithms

This repository contains simple and well-commented Java implementations of popular **sorting** and **searching** algorithms.
The goal is to help beginners understand the logic behind these core concepts through practical examples and clean code.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 1. 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (`/sorting`)
Java programs that sort arrays using various algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

### 2. 🔍 Searching Algorithms (`/searching`)
Java programs that search for elements in arrays using techniques like Linear Search and Binary Search.

|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BubbleSort1.java`       | Sorts an integer array using Bubble Sort.                        |
| `BubbleSort2.java`       | Sorts a string array alphabetically using Bubble Sort.           |
| `InsertionSort.java`     | Sorts an integer array using Insertion Sort.                     |
| `MergeSort.java`         | Implements Merge Sort using Divide and Conquer strategy.         |
| `QuickSort.java`         | Sorts using Quick Sort (first element as pivot).                 |
| `QuickSortMiddle.java`   | Sorts using Quick Sort (middle element as pivot).                |
| `SelectionSort1.java`    | Sorts an integer array using Selection Sort.                     |
| `SelectionSort2.java`    | Sorts a string array alphabetically using Selection Sort.        |
